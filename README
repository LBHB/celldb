-----------------------------------------------------

Quick & dirty instructions for getting celldb up and running on a
linux server.  This also installs the infrastructure for the queue,
although a few extra steps are required to actually get the queue
running.

1. Make sure you have a web server with php extensions installed

2. Make sure mysqld is installed.

3. Copy the contents of this directory (including children) into the
   path of the web server. eg, on a linux seruver that might be
   /var/www/html/celldb/

5. In mysql, create a database called "cell". also create a user with
   full privileges for that database: id="celldb_user" pw="celldb_123"
   (these are hard coded in config.php... You can use whatever
   settings you want but they need to match the settings in
   config.php)

7. Copy config.php from the setup/ directory to the main celldb
   directory.  Edit the settings to reflect the name of your mysql
   server ($dbserver) and the login information ($dbname, $dbuser,
   $dbpassword) for for database.

8. Browse to http://hostname/celldb/setup/setup.php Assuming you've
   set up everything correctly, this should connect to the mysql
   server and create the necessary tables in the database.  Error
   messages may be informative.

9. That should be it!  Browse to "http://localhost/celldb/index.php"
   to create an account and/or log in.

---- TO DOs: 

- Document path setup for baphy to save behavior and/or analysis
figures to celldb
- Extra documentation for usage.
- Test?
