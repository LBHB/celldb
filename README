Quick & dirty instructions for getting celldb up and running on a
linux server.  This also installs the infrastructure for the queue,
although a few extra steps are required to actually get the queue
running.

1. make sure you have a web server with php extensions installed

2. make sure mysqld is installed.

3. copy the contents of this directory somewhere that it can be sent 
   out on the web. eg, /var/www/html/celldb/

4. make sure that the http server knows to pipe *.php files through 
   the PHP intepreter. this may already be configured in your server.
   if not, I think this can be done by adding these two lines to
   /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf:
       AddType application/x-httpd-php php
       DirectoryIndex index.php index.html index.html.var

5. in mysql, create a database called "cell". also create a user with 
   full privileges for cell: id="celldb_user" pw="celldb_123" (these 
   are hard coded in config.php... so you can change them if you want).

6. from the install directory, run mysql, then enter these commands:
        mysql> use cell;
        mysql> source make_celldb.sql

7. copy config.php.default to config.php and edit it to reflect the
   connection settings for your mysql database.

8. that should be it.  browse to "http://localhost/celldb/index.php"
   and try to log in.

   by default celldb manages its own accounts and will let anyone create
   a new account ($ypaccounts=0 in config.php).
   optionally ($ypaccounts=1), celldb can check passwords by running:
        "ypmatch <user> <passwd>" 
   through a shell command.
